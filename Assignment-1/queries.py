### 1. List the posts (Id, Title, Tags) for all posts that are tagged 'postgresql-9.4'
### Hint: use ``like'' -- note that tags are enclosed in '<>' in the Tags field.

### 2. Write a query to output the number of years users have been on the
### platform (assuming they started on 'CreationDate') as of September 1, 2022
### Use 'age' function that operates on dates (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-datetime.html)

### 4. Write a query to find users who have, on average, given at least 1 UpVote per
### day they have been on the platform as of September 1, 2022
### Hint: Use subtraction on "date" to get number of days between two dates.
### Count only full days (i.e., someone who joined 1.5 days ago only needs to

### 5. Write a single query to report all Badges for the users with reputation between 10000 and 11000, by joining Users and Badges.

### 6. Write a query to find all Posts who satisfy one of the following conditions:
###        - the post title contains 'postgres' and the number of views is at least 50000
###        - the post title contains 'mongodb' and the number of views is at least 25000

### 8. Find the Users who have received badges with names: "Guru" and "Curious". 
### Only report a user once even if they have received multiple badges with the above names.
### Hint: Use Intersect.
### Output columns: UserId

### 9. "Tags" field in Posts lists out the tags associated with the post in the format "<tag1><tag2>..<tagn>".
### Find the Posts with at least 6 tags, with one of the tags being postgresql (exact match).

### 10. SQL "with" clause can be used to simplify queries. It essentially allows
### specifying temporary tables to be used during the rest of the query. See Section
### 3.8.6 (6th Edition) for some examples.
###
### Write a query to find the name(s) of the user(s) with the largest number of Comments. 
### We have provided a part of the query to build a temporary table.

### Output columns: Id, DisplayName, Num_Comments

### 11. List the users who posted no comments and with at least 500 views. 
### Hint: Use "not in".
### Output Columns: Id, DisplayName

queries[11] = """

### 12. Write a query to output a list of posts with comments, such that PostType = 'Moderator nomination' 
### and the comment has score of at least 10. So there may be multiple rows with the same post
### in the output.
### Output: Id (Posts), Title, Text (Comments)

### 13. Generate a list - (Badge_Name, Num_Users) - containing the different
### badges, and the number of users who received those badges.
### Note: A user may receive the same badge multiple times -- they should only be counted once for that badge.
### Output columns: Badge_name, Num_users
### Order by Badge_name asc
### Use LIMIT to limit the output to first 20 rows.
queries[13] = """
select 0;

### 14. For each post, count the number of comments for that post.
###
### One way to do this is "Scalar" subqueries in the select clause.
### select Id,                             
### (select count(*) from comments where comments.postid = posts.id) as Num_comments
### from posts order by posts.id;
### 
### However, this takes too long, even on the relatively small database we
### have.
###
### Instead, use "left outer join" to do this task.

### Output Columns: Id, Num_Comments
### Order by: Id ascending
queries[14] = """

### 15. Generate a list - (Reputation, Num_Users) - containing the number
### of users with reputation between 1 and 100 (inclusive). If a particular reputation
### score does not have any users (e.g., 2), then that reputation should appear with a
### 0 count.
###
### HINT: Use "generate_series()" to create an inline table -- try 
### "select * from generate_series(1, 10) as g(n);" to see how it works.
### This is what's called a "set returning function", and the result can be used as a relation.
### See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-srf.html

### 16. Generalizing #14 above, associate posts with both the number of
### comments and the number of votes
### 
### As above, using scalar subqueries won't scale to the number of tuples.
### Instead use WITH and Left Outer Joins.
###
### Output Columns: Id, Num_Comments, Num_Votes
### Order by: Id ascending

### 17. Write a query to find the posts with at least 7 children (i.e., at
### least 7 other posts with that post as the parent

### 18. Find posts such that, between the post and its children (i.e., answers

### 19. Write a query to find posts where the post and the accepted answer
### are both owned by the same user (i.e., have the same "OwnerUserId") and the

### Hint: Use "not exists" for the last one.

### 20. Write a query to generate a table: 
### (VoteTypeDescription, Day_of_Week, Num_Votes)
### where we count the number of votes corresponding to each combination
### of vote type and Day_of_Week (obtained by extract "dow" on CreationDate).
### So Day_of_Week will take values from 0 to 6 (Sunday to Saturday resp.)
###
### Don't worry if a particular combination of Description and Day of Week has 
### no votes -- there should be no row in the output for that combination.
